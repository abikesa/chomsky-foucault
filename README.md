The [Chomsky-Foucault debate of 1971](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpVQ3l5P0A4) was a significant intellectual exchange between two of the 20th century's most prominent thinkers: Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault. The debate took place on Dutch television and covered a range of topics, but the main points of contention revolved around human nature, politics, and epistemology. Here's a brief summary of their positions:

**Noam Chomsky:**
1. **Human Nature:** Chomsky is a strong proponent of the idea that there is an innate human nature. He argues that humans have an inborn capacity for language, which is evident in the universality of linguistic structures across diverse cultures. This perspective is grounded in his theory of generative grammar.
2. **Politics:** Chomsky believes in the possibility of understanding objective truths about the world, and he argues for a form of anarcho-syndicalism, where workers would freely associate in communities, making decisions collectively.
3. **Epistemology:** Chomsky posits that there are objective truths in the world that can be discovered through rational inquiry. He believes that science is a tool to uncover these truths.

**Michel Foucault:**
1. **Human Nature:** Foucault is skeptical about the existence of a universal human nature. He argues that concepts of human nature are products of particular historical and cultural contexts. Instead of innate structures, he believes that societal institutions shape knowledge and behavior.
2. **Politics:** Foucault is critical of overarching narratives and ideologies, believing that power dynamics permeate society at various levels. He's more concerned with the ways knowledge and power interact to form "regimes of truth."
3. **Epistemology:** Foucault challenges the idea of objective truth, suggesting that knowledge is closely tied to power. What societies come to accept as "truth" is often a product of power relations.

In essence, while Chomsky seeks universal truths and structures (especially in language), Foucault is more focused on the historical and cultural contingencies that shape knowledge and perceptions of truth. The debate is a reflection of broader disagreements between structuralist or universalist perspectives (represented by Chomsky) and post-structuralist or relativist perspectives (represented by Foucault).

**Yours Truly:**
1. **Human Nature/Voir/Dionysian:** Its essentially chemistry and continuous with all we can discerne from [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology), and perfectly predictable from the `Periodic Table.` What is of distinction are the organic molecules, albeit shared with other forms of earthly life. These molecules are responsible for Homeostasis and the apparent violation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. All organ systems coordinate to maintain a relatively constant `Internal Environment` for cells and tissues to bathe in regardless of the changes in the `Milieu ExtÃ©rieur`. 
2. **Politics/Savoir/Type-I Error:** All [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology) operates within bounds of the external enviromental conditions. Man can't, for instance, survive on the Sun. Even flying too close to the Sun is tragic enough if anyone thought themselves exceptional. The psychology of man acts as a sentinel sytem to detect distress at the biochemical level, that man may relocate to a more nurturing and more sustainable environmenet. This is the task of the musculoskeletal system and the basis of Allostasis.
3. **Epistemology/Pouvoir/Apollonian:** From the beginning of time and to its end man was, does, and will forever live in silos. These have been geographically bounded, culturally distinct, lineages of folk who exhibit highly correlated behaviors and it the subject of [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology). Herein man attempts to fix the status quo, a Sociostasis, so that maximum local control assuages existential anxieties that arise from natural and political realities. Hierarchical structures have the most powerful as the guardians of what consistitues normal and acceptable behavior. Severe punishment is metted out do deviations from these standards
